MUSIC SAMPLE LIBRARY PROJECT SAMPLES (OR: MSLP) WHERE CREATED BY ERICK KVIST WITH HELP FROM THE PERFORMING MUSICIANS 
AND IT'S AN ONGOING PROJECT. IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE 
OR HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT: INFO@MUSICSAMPLELIBRARY.COM 

IMPORTANT!!! 
I CHOSE THE 'CC BY-NC' LICENSE TO STOP ANYONE FROM SELLING THE SAMPLES. 
BUT THE SAMPLES ARE FREE TO USE FOR ANY CREATIVE MUSICAL PURPOSES. YOU CAN SELL YOUR MUSIC MADE FROM THE SAMPLES.
BEING A NO:1 HIT SONG, MUSIC FOR TV/RADIO COMMERCIALS OR A BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE SOUNDTRACK, IT DOES NOT MATTER! 
I ONLY ASK YOU TO (IF POSSIBLE AND CONVENIENT!!) GIVE THE PROJECT CREDIT, e.g. END TITLES OR CD SLEEVE. 
OTHERWISE, DROP ME A LINE, I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHERE THE SAMPLES ARE BEING USED.

(Simply changing the samples into another file format (e.g. from wav into aif or reason into kontakt) 
does not constitute 'creative musical use' and will not give you the right to sell a sample)
